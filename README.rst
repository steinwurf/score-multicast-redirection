About
-----

This repository contains a small example of how to use the score-cpp library
for reliable multicast.
The code in this repository wraps a local UDP stream in score-cpp and sends
it to a remote multicast address.
For a final deployment of score we recommend handling everything in one
process instead of redirecting packets from localhost. That is, integrating
score within the application generating the data. However, this may also be
inconvienient if the data is generated by an external application.

The code in this repository depends on score-cpp, which is not publically
available. Please contact us at contact@steinwurf.com if you want to evaluate
the score library.

Quick Start
-----------

If you already installed a C++14 compiler, git and python on your system,
then you can clone this repository to a suitable folder::

    git clone git@github.com:steinwurf/score-multicast-redirection.git

Configure and build the project::

    cd score-multicast-redirection
    python waf configure
    python waf build

Install the binaries into a folder. Here we just create an "install" directory::

    python waf install --install_path=install --install_shared_libs --install_static_libs

..
.. Run the unit tests::
..
..     python waf --run_tests
